# Data3406 Assignment 2




# Overview and Motivation
You will work in a group to tackle a data analysis problem, putting into practice aspects of the human-in-the-loop data analysis from the lectures and tutorials.

You will complete a data analysis project that starts with a core driving question, chosen from the set provided.  These are outlined in the Week 7 lecture. 

Within each tutorial group, each group will tackle a different driving problem -- more than one group in a class can be working with the same dataset.

You will use a supplied dataset to tackle that question.

Your group will keep all materials and co-ordination information on a Github site using a:

-   README which overview all the key information about your work, with links to all the work for the report;
-   Jupyter product notebook which provides a reproducible analysis created by whole your group;
-   set of Jupyter process notebooks: including data exploration, data engineering and data analysis experiments by each team member.  Some of these may be incorporated in the product notebooks. Each team member will include each notebooks created for their mini-assignments. Other process notebooks will be the work of an individual or pair of students - all will be linked from the README list of individual contributions and each will have details of authorship, assistance, code review notes, attribution of code from other sources;
-   wiki for managing and recording the group processes and personal reflections;
-   use of Github Issues to track all the activities and their status.
 

 

# Submission requirements:


## Video presentation (maximum length 8 minutes).

-  Submit a single .mp4 file for your presentation on this Canvas site.
-  You may use any mix of tools that your group considers appropriate. This can include your notebooks and slides.

## Report

Jupyter notebooks on Sydney University Github. 
 

# Overview of the grading of the presentation

-  Weight - Description of the criteria
-  10 - explaining the driving question
-  10 - statement of anticipated benefit
-  10 - outline one key ethical aspect of the raw data
-  10 - one highlight of the nature of the raw data
-  20 - carefully selected highlights of results
-  10 - outline one key ethical aspect of the meaningfulness of the results
-  10 - careful and appropriate indication of uncertainty in the information presented
-  10 - all information displays clear, with captions, labels, units
-  10 - presentation quality
 

# Overview of the grading of the report
 

This is based on your Github site and the checklists provide details of each part

-  Weight - Description of the criteria
-  10 - README
-  10 - ethical analysis
-  10 - Use of Issues and wiki for group processes
-  10 - Reflection on group processes
-  10 - Report of Think-aloud and Cognitive Walkthrough and reflection of lessons learnt
Product notebook:
-  10 - literate programming
-  10 - code quality overall, including raw data processing and data engineering and testing
-  10 - presentation of information clear, consistent, easy to understand, careful accounting for uncertainty
-  10 - presentation and organisation 
-  10 - holistic assessment based on all the above and going beyond the core (e.g. considering additional datasets, additional driving questions) - note that groups are only eligible for this part of the marks if each of the above criteria have earned a grade of D+ as described below.
-  Note:  The Process Notebooks reflect individual contributions and are part of the hurdle for the group mark.

 

 

# Minimum requirements used to grade each criterion.

-  HD - full marks: Outstanding for all aspects on the relevant checklist items. Excellent presentation in terms of clarity, structure, written expression and layout.
-  D - HD:  All aspects are solid and at least half are done very well. Excellent presentation.
-  Cr - D: Most aspects attempted and at least half are solid. Good presentation.
-  P - Cr: Most aspects attempted. 
 

# Overview of checkpoints and deadlines in mini-assignments and tutorials:


-  Due Week 7: Form groups and select problem and dataset. Initial set of Issues.
-  Due Week 8: Checkpoint for individual data exploration process notebook to gain understanding. Issues for task allocation among team members and agreed deadlines.
-  Due Week 9: Checkpoint for individual data analysis process notebook towards the driving question.
-  Due Week 10: Checkpoint for outline of your group's product notebook.
-  Due Week 11: Checkpoint for Github Issues to be resolved in the last week of the project. Deadline for video.
-  Due Week 12: Video presentation in tute. Deadline for the report.
